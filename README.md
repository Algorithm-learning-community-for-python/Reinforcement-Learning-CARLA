# CARLA-Reinforcement learning
In this repository Deep Q-Learning is used for self-driving vehicle in CARLA environment. The algorithm is implemented in a quite simple environment with few surrounding vehicle. An example of the acverage reward can be seen bellow. Note that the agent requires to be trained longer than the figure provided with more obstacles on the road.
